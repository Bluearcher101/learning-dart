//as you can see in the above Set, the String variable osama had the same value as the "rami" so only one was printed
//note that the same .(function) can be applied to (Set), as in .isEmpty, .addAll, .length, etc....
//when using .addAll make sure to add them in (List) data type, there you can make the values of that list (Set) as in to make it nested
