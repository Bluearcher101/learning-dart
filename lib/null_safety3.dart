void main () {
//the word null is used when ever the variable does have any identification attached to it to make it runnable there has to be a ? put on the end of the datatype. example:
String? name  ;
//whenever you try to use a null variable you will see an error however you can medigate this by putting ! in the end of the id in the function code. example:
//note that this trick should be used whenever you are sure that this value isnt a null, otherwise its basicly useless and its better to let the compiler identify the null for you

//you can also use another code to let the computer know that you are gonna identify this value later on in the code by using "late" in the beggining of the code. example.
late String lastname ;
lastname = "Alsabbagh" ;
print(lastname) ; 
//this can better be used in flutter since you can identify something with nothing in that variable code so you can use "late" to make it clear
