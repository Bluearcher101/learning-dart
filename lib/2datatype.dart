void main () {
  //there are diffirant kinds of ways to identify a variable and the following are the most popular examples:
  String name = "Rami" ; //it used for text and it has to have "" between the words for the language to identify that its text
 int age = 23 ; //it is used for numbers and it does not need any marks to identify it
 double kilo = 2.5 ; //and it is used for decimel numbers
 bool dumbass = true ; // it is used to identify something to be true or false

 //variables can be printed together using the "$name $name". example:
 print("$name $age") ;
//note that spaces between the variables inside the print function do affect on how it looks whenever you run it. example;
print("$name            $age") ;
