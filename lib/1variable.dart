void main () {
 //How to register a variable in the system : type name = input. note that you cannot make the var name with special characters or
 //begining with a number or the key words in dart syntx like: 'await' 'async' ect....
 //example:
 String name = "Rami" ; 
 int age = 23 ;
 print(name) ;
 print(age) ;

 //the var can be identified with "$name"
 //example:
 print("allah hayo $name") ;

 //note that you cannot identify the var more than one time like here
 int kilo = 35 ;
 kilo = 55 ;
 print(kilo) ;
 //here since there are two ids for kilo, you will see when you run it that it uses the last identifible var for kilo which was 55
